# Appchains in Tanssi Overview {: #appchains-tanssi-overview }

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Appchains deployed through Tanssi as ContainerChains have many [distinct features](/learn/tanssi/overview/#what-tanssi-provides){target=_blank}, such as block production as a service.

However, because Tanssi ContainerChains are built with a [modular framework](/learn/framework/overview/){target=_blank}, they offer many other unique advantages at a runtime level that make them quite extensible. This [unique modularity](/learn/framework/modules/){target=_blank} allows a developer to add functionality directly into the runtime or extend the capabilities of the EVM itself via precompiled contracts. 

For example, by including modules from [Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier){traget=_blank}, an Appchain can be fully Ethereum-compatible like [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network){target=_blank}. 

Furthermore, the framework used at the heart of Appchains deployed through Tanssi provides specific characteristics that developers should know and that they can leverage as well.

This section covers the fundamentals of a Tanssi ContainerChains, from its architecture to some of the core modules and funcionailities and the transaction fee mechanism.

## General Architecture of Appchains in Tanssi {: #appchains-architecture}

As previously discussed, Appchains deployed through Tanssi (ContainerChains) are customizable blockchains that, among other features, have block production as a service and inherit block finality (consensus) from Polkadot. Consequently, they act as Layer 1 blockchains like Moonbeam, not Layer 2 solutions on top of another Layer 1.

In contrast, each ContainerChain will host its own Data Preservers, which contain full archive nodes of the ContainerChain they are hosted in. Still, they will be incentivized through the data-retrieval-as-a-service provided by Tanssi. These Data Preservers will provide the RPC infrastructure for apps and users interacting with Tanssi and ContainerChains.

Therefore, when a user initiates a transaction in a Tanssi ContainerChain, RPC providers will gossip about the transaction via the transaction pool. A block producer that Tanssi has assigned to that specific ContainerChain will pick the transaction up and include it in the next ContainerChain block. Then, the state transitions generated by the transactions of that block are verified by Polkadot, and that verification is attested into a Polkadot block. Lastly, that Polkadot block is finalized.
