## The technology behind Polkadot and Parachains

Polkadot -and the parachains- are built with an open-source blockchain development framework called Substrate, which is bases on Rust programming language.

Substrate makes it easy for teams to develop blockchains, providing pre built core functinalities such as consensus mechanisms, staking & governance, account and assets management, networking and many more ready to use modules and libraries.

The core principles of Substrate are ease of use and performance, allowing teams to create specialized blockchains for any use case, with high level of performance, flexibility, and robustness.
