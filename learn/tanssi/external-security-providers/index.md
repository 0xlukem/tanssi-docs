# External Security Providers

Tanssi integrates external security providers to strengthen the flexibility and resilience of its ecosystem. By adopting decentralized security models, these providers deliver customized solutions that address diverse operational needs, ensuring greater levels of security and trust across networks.

This approach addresses common challenges developers face, such as securing significant economic resources or negotiating with operators to maintain nodes. Through Tanssi's collaborative security framework, developers can bypass these obstacles and focus on innovation, leveraging a secure and scalable infrastructure to streamline the deployment of networks.
