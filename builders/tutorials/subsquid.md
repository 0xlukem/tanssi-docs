# Using Subsquid to Index Your ContainerChain

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Subsquid](https://subsquid.io){target=_blank} is a data network that allows rapid and cost-efficient retrieval of blockchain data from 100+ chains using Subsquidâ€™s decentralized data lake and open-source SDK. In very simple terms, Subsquid can be thought of as an ETL (extract, transform, and load) tool with a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/){target=_blank} server included. It enables comprehensive filtering, pagination, and even full-text search capabilities.

Subsquid has native and full support for both EVM and Substrate data. Subsquid offers a Substrate Archive and Processor and an EVM Archive and Processor. The Substrate Archive and Processor can be used to index both Substrate and EVM data. This allows developers to extract on-chain data from any Tanssi ContainerChain and process EVM logs as well as Substrate entities (events, extrinsics, and storage items) in one single project and serve the resulting data with one single GraphQL endpoint. If you exclusively want to index EVM data, it is recommended to use the EVM Archive and Processor.

This tutorial is a step-by-step guide to building a squid to index EVM data from start to finish. It's recommended that you follow along taking each step described on your own, but you can also find a [complete version of the Squid built in this tutorial here](https://github.com/themacexpert/tanssiSquid){target=_blank}.  

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need to have:

- [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/){target=_blank}
- [Docker Compose installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/){target=_blank}
- An empty Hardhat project. For step-by-step instructions, please refer to the [Creating a Hardhat Project](/builders/interact/ethereum-api/dev-env/hardhat/#creating-a-hardhat-project){target=_blank} section of our Hardhat documentation page

--8<-- 'text/common/general-js-tutorial-check.md'

## Deploying an ERC-20 with Hardhat {: #deploying-an-erc20-with-hardhat }

Before we can index anything with Subsquid we need to make sure we have something to index! In this section we'll show you how to deploy an ERC-20 to your EVM Container Chain and we'll write a quick script to fire off a series of transfers that will be picked up by our Subsquid indexer. 

Ensure that you have initialized an empty hardhat project via the instructions in the [Creating a Hardhat Project](/builders/interact/ethereum-api/dev-env/hardhat/#creating-a-hardhat-project){target=_blank} section of our Hardhat documentation page.

In this section, we'll configure our Hardhat project for the Demo EVM ContainerChain, create an ERC-20 contract, and write scripts to deploy and interact with our contract.

Before we dive into creating our project, let's install a couple of dependencies that we'll need: the [Hardhat Ethers plugin](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-ethers){target=_blank} and [OpenZeppelin contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/){target=_blank}. The Hardhat Ethers plugin provides a convenient way to use the [Ethers](/builders/build/eth-api/libraries/ethersjs){target=_blank} library to interact with the network. We'll use OpenZeppelin's base ERC-20 implementation to create an ERC-20. To install both of these dependencies, you can run:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers ethers @openzeppelin/contracts
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers ethers @openzeppelin/contracts
    ```

!!! remember
    **You should never store your private keys in a JavaScript or Python file. It is done in this tutorial for ease of demonstration only. You should always manage your private keys with a designated secret manager or similar service.**

Now we can edit `hardhat.config.js` to include the following network and account configurations for our ContainerChain. You can replace the Demo EVM ContainerChain values with the respective parameters for your own EVM ContainerChain which can be found at [apps.tanssi.network](https://apps.tanssi.network/){target=_blank}

???+ code "hardhat.config.js"

    ```js
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/subsquid/hardhat-config.js'
    ```

### Create an ERC-20 Contract {: #create-an-erc-20-contract }

For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll be creating a simple ERC-20 contract. We'll rely on OpenZeppelin's ERC-20 base implementation. We'll start by creating a file for the contract and naming it `MyTok.sol`:

```bash
mkdir -p contracts && touch contracts/MyTok.sol
```

Now we can edit the `MyTok.sol` file to include the following contract, which will mint an initial supply of MYTOKs and allow only the owner of the contract to mint additional tokens:

???+ code "MyTok.sol"

    ```solidity
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/subsquid/MyTok.sol'
    ```


### Deploy an ERC-20 Contract {: #deploy-erc-20-contract }

Now that we have our contract set up, we can compile and deploy our contract.

To compile the contract, you can run:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

![Compile contracts using Hardhat](/images/builders/tutorials/subsquid/subsquid-1.png)

This command will compile our contract and generate an `artifacts` directory containing the ABI of the contract.

To deploy our contract, we'll need to create a deployment script that deploys our ERC-20 contract and mints an initial supply of MYTOKs. We'll use Alith's account to deploy the contract, and we'll specify the initial supply to be 1000 MYTOK. The initial supply will be minted and sent to the contract owner, which is Alith.

Let's take the following steps to deploy our contract:

Create a directory and file for our script:

```bash
mkdir -p scripts && touch scripts/deploy.js
```

In the `deploy.js` file, go ahead and add the following script:

???+ code "deploy.js"

    ```ts
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/subsquid/deploy.js'
    ```

Run the script using the `dev` network configurations we set up in the `hardhat.config.js` file:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network demo
```

The address of the deployed contract should be printed to the terminal. Save the address, as we'll need it to interact with the contract in the following section.

### Transfer ERC-20s {: #transfer-erc-20s }

Since we'll be indexing `Transfer` events for our ERC-20, we'll need to send a few transactions that transfer some tokens from Alith's account to our other test accounts. We'll do this by creating a simple script that transfers 10 MYTOKs to Baltathar, Charleth, Dorothy, and Ethan. We'll take the following steps:

Create a new file script to send transactions:

```bash
touch scripts/transactions.js
```

In the `transactions.js` file, add the following script. You'll need to insert the contract address of your deployed MyTok contract that was output in the console in the prior step.


???+ code "transactions.js"

    ```ts
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/subsquid/transactions.js'
    ```


Run the script to send the transactions:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/transactions.js --network demo
```

As each transaction is sent, you'll see a log printed to the terminal.

![Send transactions using Hardhat](/images/builders/tutorials/subsquid/subsquid-2.png)

Now we can move on to creating our Squid to index the data on our local development node.

## Create a Subsquid Project {: #create-a-subsquid-project }

Now we're going to create our Subquid project. First, we'll need to install the [Subsquid CLI](https://docs.subsquid.io/squid-cli/){target=_blank}:

```bash
npm i -g @subsquid/cli@latest
```

To verify successful installation, you can run

```bash
sqd --version
```

Now we'll be able to use the `sqd` command to interact with our Squid project. To create our project, we're going to use the `-t` flag, which will create a project from a template. We'll be using the EVM Squid template, which is a starter project for indexing EVM chains.

You can run the following command to create an EVM Squid named `tanssi-squid`:

```bash
sqd init tanssi-squid --template evm
```

This will create a Squid with all of the necessary dependencies. You can go ahead and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd tanssi-squid && npm ci
```

Now that we have a starting point for our project, we'll need to configure our project to index ERC-20 `Transfer` events taking place on our Tanssi ContainerChain.

### Index ERC-20 Transfers {: #index-erc-20-transfer events}

In order to index ERC-20 transfers, we'll need to take a series of actions:

1. Update the database schema and generate models for the data
2. Use the `ERC20` contract's ABI to generate TypeScript interface classes that will be used by our Squid to index `Transfer` events
3. Configure the processor to process `Transfer` events for the `ERC20` contract from our ContainerChain. Then we'll add logic to process the `Transfer` events and save the processed transfer data

As mentioned, we'll first need to define the database schema for the transfer data. To do so, we'll edit the `schema.graphql` file, which is located in the root directory, and create a `Transfer` entity and `Account` entity. You can copy and paste the below schema, ensuring that any existing schema is first removed.

???+ code "schema.graphql"

    ```graphql
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/subsquid/schema.graphql'
    ```


Now we can generate the entity classes from the schema, which we'll use when we process the transfer data:

```bash
sqd codegen
```

In the next step, we'll use the ERC-20 ABI to automatically generate TypeScript interface classes. Below is a generic ERC-20 standard ABI. Copy and paste it into a file named `erc20.json` in the abi folder at the root level of the project. 

??? code "erc20.json"

    ```json
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/subsquid/erc20.json'
    ```


Next, we can use our contract's ABI to generate TypeScript interface classes. We can do this by running:

```bash
sqd typegen
```

![Run Subsquid commands](/images/builders/tutorials/subsquid/subsquid-3.png)

This will generate the related TypeScript interface classes in the `src/abi/erc20.ts` file. For this tutorial, we'll be accessing the `events` specifically.

### Configure the Processor {: #configure-the-processor}  

The `processor.ts` file tells Subsquid exactly what data you'd like to ingest. Transforming that data into the exact desired format will take place at a later step. In `processor.ts`, we'll need to indicate a data source, contract address, the event(s) to index, and a block range. 

Open up the `src` folder and head to the `processor.ts` file. You'll see the line `export const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor()` followed by `.setDataSource`. We'll need to make a few changes here. Subsquid has [available archives for many chains](https://docs.subsquid.io/evm-indexing/supported-networks/){target=_blank} that can speed up the data retrieval process, but it's unlikely your containerchain has a hosted archive already. But not to worry, Subsquid can easily get the data it needs via your ContainerChain's RPC URL. Go ahead and comment out or delete the archive line. Once done, your code should look similar to the below:

```ts
    .setDataSource({
        // Lookup archive by the network name in Subsquid registry
        // See https://docs.subsquid.io/evm-indexing/supported-networks/
        chain: {
            url: assertNotNull(process.env.RPC_ENDPOINT),
            rateLimit: 300
        }
    })
```

You'll need to provide the RPC URL for your ContainerChain in your `.env` file. Make sure that any existing RPC URLs are removed. If you're using the Demo EVM ContainerChain, the respective line in your .env file will look like this: 

```
RPC_ENDPOINT={{ networks.dancebox.rpc_url }}
```

Of course, we need to tell the Subsquid processor which contract we're interested in. Create a constant for the address in the following manner: 

```
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'.toLowerCase();
```

The `.toLowerCase()` is critical because the Subsquid processor is case sensitive, and some block explorers format contract addresses with capitalization. Now, let's define the event that we want to index by adding the following: 

```ts
    .addLog({
        address: [CONTRACT_ADDRESS],
        topic0: [erc20.events.Transfer.topic],
        transaction: true,
    })
```

The `Transfer` event is defined in `erc20.ts` which was auto-generated when `sqd typegen` was run. The import `import * as erc20 from './abi/erc20'` is already included as part of the Squid EVM template. 

Block range is an important value to modify to narrow the scope of the blocks you're indexing. For example, if you launched your ERC-20 at block `650000`, there is no need to query the chain before that block for transfer events. Setting an accurate block range will improve the performance of your indexer. You can set the earliest block to begin indexing in the following manner: 

```
    .setBlockRange({from: 632400,})
```

The chosen start block here corresponds the relevant block to begin indexing on the Demo EVM ContainerChain, but you should change it to one relevant to your ContainerChain and indexer project. 

Change `setFields` section to specify the following data for our processor to ingest:

```ts
    .setFields({
        log: {
            topics: true,
            data: true,
        },
        transaction: {
            hash: true,
        },
    })
```

We also need to add the following imports to our `processor.ts` file: 

```ts
import {Store} from '@subsquid/typeorm-store'
import * as erc20 from './abi/erc20'
```

Once you've completed the prior steps, your `processor.ts` file should look similar to this:

???+ code "processor.ts"

    ```ts
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/subsquid/processor.ts'
    ```


### Transform the Data in Main.ts {: #transform-the-data-in-main.ts}  

While `processor.ts` determines the data being consumed, `main.ts` determines the bulk of actions related to processing and transforming that data. In the simplest terms, we are processing the data that was ingested via the Subsquid processor and inserting the desired pieces into a TypeormDatabase. For more detailed information on how Subsquid works, be sure to check out the [Subsquid Docs on Developing a Squid](https://docs.subsquid.io/basics/squid-development/){target=_blank}

Our `main.ts` file is going to scan through each processed block for the transfer event and decode the transfer details, including the sender, receiver, and amount. The script also fetches account details for involved addresses and creates transfer objects with the extracted data. The script then inserts these records into a Typeorm Database enabling them to be easily queried. We'll demo a sample query in the next step. You can copy and paste the below code into your `main.ts` file:


???+ code "main.ts"

    ```ts
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/subsquid/main.ts'
    ```


Now we've taken all of the steps necessary and are ready to run our indexer!

### Run the Indexer {: #run-indexer }

To run our indexer, we're going to run a series of `sqd` commands:

1. Build our project

    ```bash
    sqd build
    ```

2. Launch the database:

    ```bash
    sqd up
    ```

3. Remove the database migration file that comes with the EVM template and generate a new one for our new database schema:

    ```bash
    sqd migration:clean
    sqd migration:generate
    ```

4. Launch the processor:

    ```bash
    sqd process
    ```

In your terminal, you should see your indexer starting to process blocks!

## Querying your Squid {: #querying-your-squid }

To query your squid, open up a new terminal window within your project and run the following command:

```
sqd serve
```

And that's it! You can now run queries against your Squid on the the GraphQL playground at [http://localhost:4350/graphql](http://localhost:4350/graphql){target=_blank}. Try crafting your own GraphQL query, or use the below one:

???+ code "sample-query.graphql"

    ```ts
    --8<-- 'code/tutorials/subsquid/sample-query.graphql'
    ```


![Running queries in GraphQL playground](/images/builders/tutorials/subsquid/subsquid-5.png)


## Debugging your Squid {: #debugging-your-squid }

It may seem tricky at first to debug errors when building your Squid, but fortunately there are several techniques you can use to streamline this process. First and foremost, if you're facing errors with your Squid, you should enable Debug mode in your .env file by uncommenting the debug mode line. This will trigger much more verbose logging and will help you locate the source of the error. 

```
# Uncommenting the below line enables debug mode
SQD_DEBUG=*
```

See the [Subsquid guide to logging](https://docs.subsquid.io/basics/logging/){target=_blank} for more information on debug mode. 


### Common Errors {: #common-errors }

Below are some common errors you may face building a project and how you can solve them:

```
Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint my-awesome-squid-db-1 
(49df671a7b0531abbb5dc5d2a4a3f5dc7e7505af89bf0ad1e5480bd1cdc61052): 
Bind for 0.0.0.0:23798 failed: port is already allocated

```

This error indicates that you have another instance of Subsquid running somewhere else. You can stop that gracefully with the command `sqd down` or by pressing the Stop button next to the container in Docker Desktop. 

```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:23798
     at createConnectionError (node:net:1634:14)
     at afterConnectMultiple (node:net:1664:40) {
     errno: -61,code: 'ECONNREFUSED',syscall: 'connect',
     address: '127.0.0.1',port: 23798}]}
```

To resolve this, run `sqd up` before you run `sqd migration:generate`

Is your Squid error-free yet you aren't seeing any transfers detected? Make sure your log events are consistent and identical to the ones your processor is looking for. Your contract address also needs to be lowercase, which you can be assured of by defining in a fashion as follows:

```
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = '0x37822de108AFFdd5cDCFDaAa2E32756Da284DB85'.toLowerCase();
```
