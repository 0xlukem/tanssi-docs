# Interacting with your Tanssi EVM ContainerChain Using Talisman

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Developers and users of Tanssi EVM ContainerChains have a variety of options when it comes to wallets. Thanks to their seamless Ethereum compatibility, Tanssi EVM ContainerChains support a great variety of popular wallets such as Talisman. 

Talisman is a Web3 wallet that natively supports Substrate (Polkadot) and Ethereum accounts. This tutorial centers on the Ethereum API, but you can check out a similar tutorial for interacting with Talisman using the Substrate API. The Talisman wallet browser extension is available on [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/talisman-polkadot-wallet/fijngjgcjhjmmpcmkeiomlglpeiijkld){target=_blank}, [Brave](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/talisman-polkadot-wallet/fijngjgcjhjmmpcmkeiomlglpeiijkld){target=_blank}, and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/talisman-wallet-extension/){target=_blank}, and a corresponding asset dashboard is accessible at [app.talisman.xyz](https://app.talisman.xyz/){target=_blank}

This guide takes you through all the necessary steps: from installing Talisman, to setting up a wallet, connecting it to your Tanssi EVM ContainerChain, and sending funds.

After creating your first account, you'll be prompted to back up your seed phrase. This is an important step, especially because you have the option to later derive additional accounts from this seed phrase.
