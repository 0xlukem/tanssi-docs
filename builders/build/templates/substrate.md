description: Tanssi includes templates to kick-start the development of an Appchain, one for a Substrate-oriented runtime and another featuring full EVM (Ethereum) support.

# Templates Overview {: #templates-overview }

## Baseline Appchain Template {: #baseline-appchain-template }

Developing a Substrate-based runtime typically involves two primary steps:

1. [Incorporating pre-existing Substrate built-in modules](/builders/build/local/adding-built-in-pallet/){target=_blank} into the runtime
2. [Creating custom modules](/builders/build/local/adding-custom-made-module/){target=_blank} tailored to your specific application needs

Since the provided template already includes the essential configurations for seamless integration into the Polkadot ecosystem and compatibility with the Tanssi protocol, teams interested in constructing an innovative Appchain can use this template as a starting point for adding their custom logic.

Here are some of the features that come with this template:

- Utilize Tanssi's [block production as a service](/learn/tanssi/technical-features/#block-production-as-a-service){target=_blank}
- Use [Polkadot's finality gadget](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-consensus#finality-gadget-grandpa){target=_blank}
- Benefit from [Polkadot's shared security model](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains#shared-security){target=_blank}
- Use the [Polkadot.js API](/builders/interact/substrate-api/polkadot-js-api){target=_blank} to interact with the Substrate API

By leveraging these features in the template, you can kickstart your Appchain development and customize it to meet your specific requirements and innovations.
