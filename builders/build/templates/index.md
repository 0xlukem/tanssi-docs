# Network Templates 

Kickstart your network development with our comprehensive templates. Designed for rapid deployment, these templates provide a strong foundation for both EVM and non-EVM solutions, accelerating your production journey.

As presented in the [Network Templates Included in Tanssi](/learn/networks/included-templates/){target=\_blank} page from the Learn section, Tanssi already provides two templates to jumpstart the development process:

- **[Baseline Tanssi network template](/learn/networks/included-templates#baseline-network-template){target=\_blank}** - a template that provides the basic platform to start adding custom logic
- **[Baseline Tanssi EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) network template](/learn/networks/included-templates/#baseline-evm-template){target=\_blank}** - a template that provides full Ethereum compatibility

Learn more about each template, the minimum requirements for your chain to function on Tanssi, and  what modules are automatically included on the [Template Overview](/builders/build/templates/overview/) page.
