# Templates Overview {: #templates-overview }

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Networks deployed through Tanssi are fully customizable blockchains benefiting from a shared set of sequencers and the security of a provider of their choice. The templates presented in this article implement the necessary functionalities and configurations to support the Tanssi protocol, making development easier.

## Choosing the Right Template

Selecting the right template is the first step in building your Tanssi-powered network. Whether you need a standard, fully customizable blockchain, or one that is EVM-compatible, both templates provide basic configurations, along with benefits like block production as a service, deterministic transaction finality, and the option to choose your security provider, such as [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/){target=\_blank}.

**Baseline template:**

- **Minimalistic design** - includes only the essential configurations for compatibility with Tanssi, making it an ideal base for adding custom modules
- **Tailored runtime** - provides the flexibility to expand functionality by integrating existing or custom-built modules
- **Highly configurable** - adapt the template to meet unique requirements for governance, economics, or consensus

**Baseline EVM template:**

- **Ready to deploy** - comes fully configured for Ethereum compatibility, requiring no runtime changes if the application is built on EVM
- **Ethereum ecosystem integration** - supports Ethereum tools and libraries like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}, [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/){target=\_blank}, [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/){target=\_blank}, and [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/){target=\_blank}
- **Smart contract deployment** - deploy EVM smart contracts seamlessly using familiar tools

In this article, the required base setup and how to use the templates as a starting point to start building your Tanssi network are presented.

## Base Setup to Support the Tanssi Protocol {: #base-setup-supporting-tanssi }

Tanssi networks must implement the following modules to support the protocol and benefit safely from Tanssi's block production as a service:

- **Author Noting** - registers the set of sequencers assigned to the network by Tanssi
- **Author Inherent** - Allows the sequencer authoring the block to include its identity to get validated and rewarded

If you don't include these modules in the Tanssi network's runtime, there won't be a method to confirm that the blocks are being generated by trustworthy sequencers designated by the Tanssi orchestrator. This could create a vulnerability for malicious actors to exploit and compromise the network. For more information about Tanssi's block production as a service please refer to the [Block Production Services](/learn/tanssi/network-services/block-production/){target=\_blank} article.

Besides block production, there are other essential aspects for any network covered in the templates, such as:

- **Consensus** - networks have the necessary functionality to allow the sequencers to produce blocks, gossip and validate them, and coordinate with the security provider to get notified about the block's finality
- **Networks Interoperability** - handles the ingestion and dispatch of incoming downward and lateral messages, allowing a Tanssi network to communicate and interoperate with the other chains within the ecosystem
- **Runtime Upgrades** - a runtime upgrade in a Tanssi network must be informed to the security provider's operators to allow them to check on the blocks produced by the sequencers of the Tanssi networks

## Included Modules {: #included-modules }

Besides the necessary modules to support the operation of a Tanssi network, many other modules provide functional behavior that the users can interact with. 

These are some of the functional modules exposing a behavior to the users that are included in the templates and ready to use:

- **[Balances](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_balances/index.html){target=\_blank}** - the Balances module provides functions for handling accounts and balances for the Tanssi network native currency
- **[Utility](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_utility/index.html){target=\_blank}** - the Utility module provides functions to execute multiple calls in a single dispatch. Besides batching transactions, this module also allows the execution of a call from an alternative signed origin
- **[Proxy](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_proxy/index.html){target=\_blank}** - the Proxy module provides functions to delegate to other accounts (proxies) the permission to dispatch calls from a proxied origin
- **[Maintenance Mode](https://github.com/moondance-labs/moonkit/blob/tanssi-polkadot-v1.3.0/pallets/maintenance-mode/src/lib.rs){target=\_blank}** - the Maintenance Mode module allows the Tanssi network to be set to a mode where it doesn't execute balance/asset transfers or other transactions. This could be useful when upgrading the runtime in an emergency, when executing large storage migrations, or when a security vulnerability is discovered
- **[Tx Pause](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/frame/tx-pause/src/lib.rs){target=\_blank}** - the Tx Pause module allows a valid origin (typically Root) to pause (and unpause) an entire module or a single transaction. A paused transaction (or all the transactions included in a paused module) will fail when called until it is unpaused. This module provides a higher degree of granularity compared to maintenance mode, making it particularly useful when a faulty or vulnerable transaction is identified in the runtime
- **[Multisig](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/frame/multisig/src/lib.rs){target=\_blank}** - the Multisig module enables transaction dispatches that require -typically- more than one signature. A multisig transaction defines a set of authorized accounts and a threshold for its approval, requiring consensus among multiple parties

## Start Building {: #getting-started }

To start building on top of the provided templates, be it the [Baseline Tanssi network template](/builders/build/templates/substrate/){target=\_blank} or the [Baseline EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) template](/builders/build/templates/evm/){target=\_blank}, the recommended approach is to fork the [Tanssi repository](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi){target=\_blank} and start adding [built-in modules](/builders/build/customize/adding-built-in-module/){target=\_blank} or [custom-made modules](/builders/build/customize/adding-custom-made-module/){target=\_blank} on top of the [latest release](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/releases/latest){target=\_blank} tag.

This approach comes with some advantages, such as:

- Building on top of the latest and stable release
- Get the Tanssi protocol already configured and included in the template runtime
- Keep your fork up-to-date by syncing with the Tanssi upstream repository
- Run the included tests, ensuring that block production on your Tanssi network works as intended
- Run a complete local environment with the included [Zombienet](https://paritytech.github.io/zombienet){target=\_blank} configuration

If the templates already cover your use case needs, or after building and testing your chain, you can continue with the [Deploy your Tanssi network via the Tanssi dApp](/builders/deploy/dapp/){target=\_blank} article to know how to use the Tanssi dApp to register and get your chain up and running.
