# Onboarding

Starting your journey as a sequencer begins here. This section covers the foundational steps to set up your node and prepare your account for active participation in the Tanssi network.

Getting Started as a Sequencer:

- [**Hardware requirements**](/node-operators/sequencers/onboarding/run-a-sequencer/#hardware-requirements) - understand the recommended hardware specifications to ensure optimal performance of your sequencer node
- [**Port configuration**](/node-operators/sequencers/onboarding/run-a-sequencer/#required-network-ports) - learn which network ports need to be open to facilitate proper communication within the Tanssi ecosystem
- **Session keys setup** - detailed instructions on [generating](/node-operators/sequencers/onboarding/account-setup/#map-account) and [managing](/node-operators/sequencers/onboarding/account-setup/#map-session-keys) session keys, a vital step for enabling block production capabilities
- **Node deployment** - choose between [Docker](/node-operators/sequencers/onboarding/run-a-sequencer/sequencers-docker/) and [systemd](/node-operators/sequencers/onboarding/run-a-sequencer/sequencers-systemd/) for deploying your node, with step-by-step guides tailored for each method
