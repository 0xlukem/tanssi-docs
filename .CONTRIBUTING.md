# Contribution Guidelines

The documentation source files are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and generally follow the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).

Please review the guidelines mentioned throughout this document, and when ready, you can open a PR against the `main` branch. Typically from there, someone from the Tanssi Developer Relations team will review the PR and request any changes as needed. Then the team will merge your PR into a local branch and make sure that all of the formatting changes look good on the local site. Once everything is all set and done the changes will be published to the live site.

Thank you for your contributions, they are greatly appreciated ðŸ’œ.

## Previewing Changes

To preview your changes, you can follow these steps:

1. Fork and clone the [`tanssi-mkdocs` repo](https://github.com/papermoonio/tanssi-mkdocs)
2. Add your clone of the [`tanssi-docs` repo](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi-docs) inside the root directory of `tanssi-mkdocs`
3. Run the following command to install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Then run `mkdocs serve`, which will build and serve the docs site on [port 8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

### Previewing Changes in VS Code

If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can preview the changes you're making to `.md` files before committing them. To learn how, please check out the [Markdown and Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown) guide from the Visual Studio docs site.

## Structure

In the root directory and every subdirectory, in addition to the content directories and pages, you'll find the following files:

- **`.pages`** - defines the structure of the documentation site
- **`index.md`**- represents the [landing pages](https://docs.tanssi.network/builders/) and serves as an entry point for each section, offering an overview and facilitating easy navigation to related content

### Example `.pages` file

Below is an example of a `.pages` file:

```markdown
title: Builders
hide: false
nav:
  - index.md
  - build
  - deploy
  - interact
  - technicals
```

Some important things to note:

- The `title` field at the top of the page represents the display name for the subdirectory
- The `index.md` page should always be the first item in the list
- Files follow the convention of 'Display Name': 'file-name.md'
- Subdirectories are listed by their directory name in the source code

### Example `index.md` file

Below is an example of an `index.md` file:

```markdown
---
title: Build your Decentralized Network
description: Install the software to compile your decentralized network, configure your genesis state and core functionalities, test locally and get ready to deploy through Tanssi.
icon: octicons-code-24
template: index-page.html
---

<!-- Add content in markdown here --> 

## Explore What This Section Covers

:::INSERT_GENERATED_CARDS:::
```
Some important things to note:

- The `title` represents the `<title>` tag and is used for SEO purposes
- The `description` represents the meta-description and is also used for SEO purposes
- The `icon` is used on index pages (`index.md`). It should be an icon representative of the content on the page. You should stick to using Octicons 24px icons, ensuring they are outlined and not filled to maintain style consistency. You can search through the available icons on the [Primer Design System website](https://primer.style/foundations/icons)
- The `<div>` is populated with links to any pages or subdirectories and is populated automatically by a script at runtime that builds the landing pages
- The `template` defines the template to be used. It should always `index-page.html` to correctly render the table of contents (TOC)
- The `## Explore What This Section Covers` serves as the title that acts as a divider between the content and the TOC
- The `:::INSERT_GENERATED_CARDS:::` is required for the `template` to function correctly and automatically generate the TOCs for each index

When adding content to an index, you should follow these minimum components:

- A clear and concise introduction explaining the central purpose of the section, no longer than two paragraphs
- Content should help readers understand the section's purpose and guide them to their destination. This may include a bullet list summarizing key points with brief descriptions, a Mermaid diagram to clarify complex information, or additional relevant details to further aid navigation

Additionally, and only when necessary, you may include external material to explain or guide users. It can be presented as a TOC similar to those automatically generated by the template. For this, you must use HTML formatting. Below is an example:

```markdown
<div class="subsection-wrapper">
  <div class="card">
    <a href="/builders/build/">
      <div class="card-header">
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24" height="24"><path d="M11.03 2.59a1.501 1.501 0 0 1 1.94 0l7.5 6.363a1.5 1.5 0 0 1 .53 1.144V19.5a1.5 1.5 0 0 1-1.5 1.5h-5.75a.75.75 0 0 1-.75-.75V14h-2v6.25a.75.75 0 0 1-.75.75H4.5A1.5 1.5 0 0 1 3 19.5v-9.403c0-.44.194-.859.53-1.144ZM12 3.734l-7.5 6.363V19.5h5v-6.25a.75.75 0 0 1 .75-.75h3.5a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75v6.25h5v-9.403Z"></path></svg>
        <h2 class="title">Build Your Network</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="description">Learn how to design and customize your network with ready-to-use templates and tools tailored to your technical needs.</p>
    </a>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Content Pages

When adding a new content page, you should have the following components:

- **`title`** - represents the `<title>` tag and is used for SEO purposes (not displayed on the published site)
- **`description`** - represents the meta-description and is also used for SEO purposes (not displayed on the published site)
- **`icon`** - defines an icon to be used on the parent section's index page. It should be an icon representative of the content on the page. You should stick to using Octicons 24px icons. You can search through the available icons on the [Primer Design System website](https://primer.style/foundations/icons)
- **Page title** - a title to be displayed at the top of the page
- **`## Introduction` section** - 2-3 paragraphs to serve as an introduction. This should be long-lived, meaning it will not require changes in the future

Optionally, you should also consider including the following sections:

- **`## Checking Prerequisites` section** - if the guide requires the user to have certain developer tools installed, for example, Docker or MetaMask, it should be listed here
- **`## Getting Started` section** - if this is a 3rd party integration, having links that point to the most important parts of your project's documentation site that helps users get started with your project

For example:

```markdown
---
title: Title for SEO purposes
description: Description for SEO purposes.
---

# Page Title

## Introduction

Write 2-3 paragraphs to serve as the introduction here.

...
```

## Images

Images are stored in the `images` subdirectory. They are organized to mirror the structure of the docs site. So, for example, if you are creating a new page for the `builders` section and need to add images, those would go under the `images/builders/` subdirectory.

Images should follow these specs:

These images are stored in the `images/index-pages` subdirectory.

To add an image to your page, you should have [alt text](https://developers.google.com/style/images#alt-text) and use the following syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text goes here](/images/<subdirectory>/<image-file-name>.webp)
```

## Snippets

Snippets can be used to manage reusable lines of code or text. There is a subdirectory for `text` and `code`.

To link to a snippet, you can use the following syntax in the Markdown file:

```markdown
--8<-- 'code/<subdirectory>/<snippet-file-name>.md'
```

Code snippets can be written in Markdown or the programming language itself, for example, `.py` for Python, `.js` for JavaScript, etc.

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Here are some resources to help you create good titles and descriptions for SEO:

- [Google's recommendation on good titles](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/appearance/title-link?hl=en)
- [Google's recommendation on good descriptions](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/appearance/snippet?hl=en)

In general, titles should be between 50 and 60 characters and descriptions should be between 110 and 160 characters.
