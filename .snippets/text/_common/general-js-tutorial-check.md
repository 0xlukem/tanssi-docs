    The examples in this guide are based on a MacOS or Ubuntu 20.04 environment. If you're using Windows, you'll need to adapt them accordingly.
    
    Furthermore, please ensure that you have Node.js and a package manager (such as npm or yarn) installed. To learn how to install Node.js, please check their [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download){target=\blank}.
